Title:  Cymrum: Labor, Wealth, and Community

Project Description:
This project highlights significant sites in northern Wales, UK from the time period of the 1700s to early 1900s.  These sites are significant to the history of the wealth of the mining industry in this region.  The use of the local natural resources, local labor, and development are highlighted here to demonstrate the importance and interconnectivity of people and the imbued meaning of these places.  Part of the goal of this project is to present the information from a local viewpoint, using local knowledge and names.

Deliverables/Outcomes:
This project will produce a map based webpage with informational pop-ups highlighting these various historical sites.

Functionality & Technology
Users will interact with the webpage by browsing the map and clicking on various sites for more information.  

Audience:
The audience is the general public, along with those folks interested in learning more about the history of northern Wales (students, locals, historians, etc).  

Data, Information, Content
