Project Vision Document Template

The project vision document is the initial (and often foundational) statement about your project.  It provides a platform to communicate (and collaborator on) the shape and scope of your project with other core project partners and potential external collaborators.  A project vision document should never exceed 2 pages.

Remember, if you are drawing data/content from another institution (museum, digital library, archive, etc), you should consider including them as partners.
